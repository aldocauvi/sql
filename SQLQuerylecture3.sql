 How many tables do we have in this database?
 4

 How many entities do we have in this database?
 3

 What is the name of our database?
 SCHOOL

 How many records do we have on each table?
 dbo.Students: 7
 dbo.Professors: 7
 dbo.Classes: 7
 debo.Registration: 4

 Which field would you add to every table (if any) and why?
 Table Students: student date of birth because there can be 2 students with the same first name and last name
 Table Professors: Email is useful information for students
 Table Classes: name of the class, number of credits. This are important characteristics of the classes.
 Table Registration: Number of credits of that section
